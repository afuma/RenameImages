# RenameImages
RenameImages is a python script wich automates the renaming of files within a specified directory by removing spaces and adding a sequential number to each image file (JPEG, JPG, PNG). Easy to use, it streamlines the management of large batches of files, making the renaming process more efficient and less tedious.
